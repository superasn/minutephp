#MinutePHP: PHP + AngularJS framework (*v.001*)#

##Framework's USP:##
- Built-in support for AngularJS
- Router can inject models into controller (that can be accessed in AngularJS)
- CRUD operations can be done with both PHP and AngularJS (with a single line on code)

##Project status##
It's highly experimental code! Just want to share the concept and code to see **if anyone interested in collaborating!**

###Facebook like newsfeed demo (in two minutes)###

**Database setup:** Contains a `user` table, `posts` table and `comments` table, plus two more tables called `posts_likes` and `comments_likes`.

**Understanding the new Router syntax:**

```php 
$r->get($url, $controller, $acl, â€¦$models)
```

The first three arguments are pretty standard:

1. *$url:* URL regex to match. Can contain placeholders (or regex). Placeholder format is ":name"
  1. Examples:
     1. /newsfeed/:user\_id/
     2. /newsfeed/:user\_id(/:page)? *[here page parameter is optional]*

2. *$controller:* format is similar to Laravel like "Filename@function"
  1. Example:
     1. Backend/Newsfeed@index *[This will invoke the index function in Backend/Newsfeed class]*

3. *$acl:* can be "true" for logged in otherwise false. Also supports strings like 'admin','power','business','trial' as defined in config file.
4. **$model objects: This is the most unique part.**
  1. What are model objects?
     1. Models are basically PHP objects that support CRUD operations (in both PHP and AngularJS). Something similar to an ORM but not that (as explained later).
     2. The model classes are automatically generated using a script. So for our sample database MinutePHP has generated 5 PHP Model classes called *Users, Posts, Comments, PostsLikes and CommentsLikes*
     3. You can specify the Read, Update, Insert, and Delete permission for each model as "same\_user", "any\_user", "all", "none", "admin", etc (explained later)

5. **The Router can inject Model objects in to the controller** automatically. 

**Here is some sample code:**

**index.php:**
```php
//$r is instance of Router
//Sample matching routes are /newsfeed/1, /newsfeed/2, etc (last digit => :user_id)
$r->get('/newsfeed/:user_id', 'Backend/Newsfeed@index', true, 'posts[user_id][]', 'users[posts.user_id] as poster')
```

Explanation of the *last two parameters*:
   
1. ***posts[user_id][]*** - find all rows in `posts` table with `user_id` matching `:user_id` in URL (the placeholder). What this will do is:
   1.  It will then create `$posts` object (instance of Posts model) with an array of matching rows loaded from our `posts` table where user_id=1 (for URL */newsfeed/1*).
   2.  It will pass the `$posts` object to the controller (see below). 
   3. It will create an AngularJS object for `$posts` that you can **access as `$scope.posts` in your view**.
   3. Example: /newsfeed/1 will fill `$posts` with all rows where `user_id=1`.
   4. The **[ ]** at end is to specify we want an array or *all* matching results.
2.  ***users[posts.user_id] as poster*** - this will create a join on `posts` and `users` table using `user_id`. As a result you will have:
   1. A `$poster` object (instance of User model) in your controller. 
   2. A references to the matching `poster` inside each row of `$posts` object.
   3. If it is getting confusing, think of it like an SQL query:
```SELECT * FROM posts as A, users as b where user_id = :user_id and b.user_id = a.user_id```
   4. It will also create an AngularJS object for you that you can access as `$scope.posts[0].poster`, `$scope.posts[1].poster.firstName`, etc in your view.
  5. Note that there is no [] at the end this time. It means that we want to load just our **first matching row** (unlike $posts which is an array of all matching records)

**Backend/Newsfeed class:**
```php
//This is called by the Router when a person accesses /newsfeed/1, /newsfeed/2, etc in browser

public function index($posts, $poster) {

    //Render Backend/Newsfeed view located in Views folder 
    //Magically create an AngularJS object for $posts

	View::make('Backend/Newsfeed', $posts); 
}
```
**Views/Backend/Newsfeed: (view)**
```html
Hello!

Write something:
<input type="text" ng-model="newtitle" />
<button ng-click="createPost();">Add post</button>
	
//posts is now an AngularJS object
<div ng-repeat="post in posts">
	<h3>{{post.title}}</h3> by post.poster.first
	
	<input type="text" ng-model="mytitle" value="changed title" />
	<button ng-click="updatePost(post);">change</button>
</div>

<script>
function extend($scope) {
	$scope.createPost = function() {
	    //will create a new post and with the user's title
		var post = $scope.posts.create().set('title', $scope.newtitle).save();
		console.log("post: ", post);
	}
		
	$scope.updatePost = function(item) {
		//will change the post's title to user input
		item.set('title', $scope.mytitle).save();
	}
}
</script>
```

###So are you with me so far? :)###

As you can see above, the View class automatically converted our $posts Model into an AngularJS object and added it to our current `$scope` as `$scope.posts`

`$scope.posts` is an array of objects on which you can iterate with ng-repeat.

`$scope.posts` is an array but it has a few functions of its own like `.create()`, `loadNextPage()`, etc. 

Each item in `$scope.posts` array (say, `PostItem`) is an object of `Record` type with functions like `set()`, `save()`, etc.

**But here is the most interesting part!**

Do you remember about our `users[posts.user_id] as poster` in the router? 

What this means to you is that we created a `$posts` array. Then we created `$poster` object (instance of Users Model) and loaded results from the users table by matching on the `user_id`.

But what this also means to you is that each item inside `$scope.posts` now also contains a reference to it's `poster` object as well.

So `{{$posts[0].poster.firstName}}` will print the first name of the poster in AngularJS.

>Too hard to comprehend? I hope not! :)

Ok, let's take a look at this route.. it's may look tough but the concept behind it is simple and once you get it, things will become very clear:

```php
$r->get('/newsfeed/:user_id', 'Backend/Newsfeed@index', false,

    'posts[user_id][2] order by post_id asc', 'users[posts.user_id] as poster',

    'postsLikes[posts.post_id][] as plikes', 'users[plikes.user_id] as pliker',

    'comments[posts.post_id][] order by comment_id desc', 'users[comments.user_id] as commenter',

    'commentsLikes[comments.comment_id][] as clikes', 'users[clikes.user_id] as cliker'
);
```

Now let's pull our parameters apart:

1. `posts[user_id][2] order by post_id asc` Same as before only difference from last time is
   1. We load only the first two records, hence the [2] instead of [] at the end. 
   2. We can load more records inside AngularJS on the `$scope.posts` by calling `$scope.posts.loadNextPage()` as you will see in the example below.
   3. You can also use posts[user_id][1,2] which will load the second page (skip the first two records)
2.  `users[posts.user_id] as poster` Same as last time. We want to load the poster of each post by creating a join on posts.user_id on the users table. Remember that since we don't have a trailing [] at the end, it tells MinutePHP we want the first matching object (not the whole array of matching results).
3. `postsLikes[posts.post_id][] as plikes` Create a `$postsLikes` object by creating a join on `posts.post_id` on the post_likes table. This time we do have a trailing [] at the end, so what this means is that we will get an array instead of single object.
4. `users[plikes.user_id] as pliker` We want to know who liked the posts. So we create a $pliker object creating a join on `users` and `postsLikes` table using user_id. Again, this is just a single object.
5. `comments[posts.post_id][] order by comment_id desc` Since each posts can have comments inside it, we create a `$comments` object joining `posts` and `comments` using `post_id`. This will return an array because of the trailing []. 
   6. Since we wish to load the comments in the reverse order in which they were posted, we add an order by clause: `order by comment_id desc` (similar to SQL).
6. `users[comments.user_id] as commenter` We surely want to know who made the comment, so we create a new `$commenter` object joining the `user_id` on the `comments` and `users` table.
7. `commentsLikes[comments.comment_id][] as clikes` This is pretty much same as postLikes, except we're using it for comments.

When we render our view all these objects will be converted to AngularJS objects. So broadly speaking our code will look something like this:

```html
<div ng-repeat="post in posts">
	{{post.title}} by {{post.poster.first}}

	<div ng-repeat="comment in post.comments">
		{{comment.title}} by {{comment.commenter.first}}		
	</div>

	<input type="text" ng-model="userinput" />
	<button ng-click="createItem(post.comments)">Add comment</button>
</div>

<input type="text" ng-model="userinput" />
<button ng-click="createItem(posts)">Add post</button>

<button ng-click="posts.loadNextPage();" ng-show="posts.$more">more</button>
```

The above will render two posts, print their titles alongwith the name of the user who made the post.

Inside each post will be all the comments with the name of the user who made it!

Similar to example #1, if you want the user to create a new post or comment, all you have to do is this:

```html
<script>
function extend($scope) {
	$scope.createItem = function(item) {
	    //will create a new post or comment
		item.create().set('title', $scope.userinput).save();
	}
}
</script>

```
